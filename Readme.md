The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.<br> <br>The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.<br><br>More information about the game is available at <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.deadbydaylight.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >http://www.deadbydaylight.com</a><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2>•\t<strong>Survive Together… Or Not</strong> - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?<br><br>•\t<strong>Where Am I?</strong> - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.<br><br>•\t<strong>A Feast for Killers</strong> - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/381210/extras/DBD_HillB_Trapper_Wraith_anime_Steam.jpg?t=1669150759\" /><br><br>•\t<strong>Deeper and Deeper</strong> - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.<br><br>•\t<strong>Real People, Real Fear</strong> - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.<br><br><br><strong>WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING</strong><br><br><i>A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns.

If you or any of your relatives has an epileptic condition or has had seizures of any kind, consult your physician before playing any video game.<br><br>IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE use and consult a physician if you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitching, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, disorientation, or convulsions. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms.<br><br>You may reduce risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued.</i>"

        "description": "The game is almost 10 years old, but I just played it for the first time.\n\nConsidering how delighted I was discovering GTAIV (details, physics, lightning) I was already sitting down to V with a certain standard in my head. I perfectly remember a similar feeling when I sat down to VC after III.\n\n[h1]Style and Feelings[/h1]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2798013381\n\nI won't elaborate, the game tastes like a really well-cooked, spiced dish, served just the way I wanted it, but damn, I didn't define \"it\" before.\n\nI remember a scene from the movie \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CX5xybN3wg]Watch![/url] The lady is sitting in a pub, drinking coffee the way she likes it. The waiter comes up, supposedly asking whether to refill, but without waiting for an answer, he pours more. Annoyed, she points out to him that she already had the perfect color and temperature and it was great (the coffee).\n\nNow:\n[olist][*]Was the physics in GTA IV better? Yes, it was, I noticed, but was it that much better? :wink: Not until I looked at those videos like \"Why GTAIV is better than V?\"\n\n[*]Are missions in V absurd and unrealistic? (because that's what I was told) Strangely enough, no, there are some unusual ones, but nowhere near the level of San Andreas!\n\n[*]Is the plot worse, incoherent? No, because this game is one big sandbox in which the creators skillfully entwined a lot of allusions. The plot isn't like one signature Christmas dish (like in VC or IV). It's like a great feast buffet where I leave full and having tasted everything, and at the end, someone next to me asked: \"Have you tried this?\" Works for me.[/olist]\n\nIn III and IV I missed wild, extra-urban areas, so I liked playing Mafia for instance. However, I will never forget the first time in SA I drove from San Fierro to Las Venturas, through those desert hills in Bone Country. I felt the same when I jumped in Trevor's shoes for the first time.\n\nThe difference between the possibilities in VC and SA was huge, in the latter, the latter there was too much of everything, and it was overwhelming. Here, it's fine, lots of mini-games (golf, tennis, yoga, etc.), enough clothes, plus jet ski, planes, car tuning. I am filled, not overfed.\n\n[h1]Characters and Plot[/h1]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2903057273\n\nInterestingly, I've managed to avoid spoilers over the years. I knew that the game bows to movies, among others \"Heat\" (1995), but I didn't know it was that much! I dressed the characters in the screen above on purpose, because they are Waingro, Donald Breedan, and Neil McCauley respectively.\n\n\n[h1]Michael[/h1]\n\nMichael started out as my favorite character and ended up being the most irritating and a bit grossed out. His attitude and character can be summed up in his final words in the A-final:\n\n[quote]Surviving is winning, Franklin, everything else is bullshit. Fairy tales spun by people too afraid to look life in the eye. Whatever it takes, kid: survive.[/quote]\n\nKeyword: Survival.\n\n\n[h1]Trevor[/h1]\n\nWhen Trevor killed John in the beginning, I thought it was an exaggerated attempt to show how dangerous and unpredictable he is. But since then, he's only gotten better. Definitely the most coherent and deep character, despite the apparent madness. His attitude and character can be summed up in his final words in the B-final:\n\n[quote]Well, I can't! You're turning on him? I've had enough traitors in my life![/quote]\n\nKeyword: Authenticity.\n\n\n[h1]Franklin[/h1]\n\nFranklin, Franklin... everything and nothing, fun and boredom. I enjoyed playing it the least but ended up losing the most hours with him. Because he is practical, he has the most useful skill, funny dialogue. A bit like beating the fourth wall, in style, the least interesting character from the \"viewer\" point of view, but the most necessary from the \"player\" point of view.\n\nKeyword: I don't know, maybe the Fourth Wall.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nI like immersing in the presented world the most, and with the enormity and variety of LS and Blaine Country and the possibility of playing from the FPP view, GTAV is a great pleasure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2796358854\n\nRandom encounters are surprising. The biggest WTF I had was when I met two old men on the road trying to rape a girl. I laughed when I picked up a drunk couple and they started banging in the back of the car. Definitely an adult game, I reminded myself when I saw the short film \"The Loneliest Robot in Great Britain\" at the cinema.\n\nI would love to release a series in which I play without radar, hud, in FPP, and roleplay. The only thing missing is the physics from IV. On the other hand, it's GTA after all, and you can really have fun with V.\n\n[h1]Post Scriptum[/h1]\n\nI forgot about the muuusic. Countless stations, I didn't have time to listen to everything yet, but the absolute number 1 is the track when we pause the game: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdEdCQYdsxQ]Listen![/url] This style, this melancholy, sometimes I just stared at the map to listen, and you know, I'm over 30, so it affects me twice. Everything seems close, here and now, and yet so far away, someday, something, somewhere... As Neil said in the \"Heat\":\n\n[quote]Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.[/quote]\nAnd so it hits an adult man, these 30 seconds, at certain moments, and these 30 minutes or days at other times, and these 30 years. Where is the dream, where is the reality?\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/lux_vq/screenshots/?appid=271590]My gallery on Steam[/url]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story & World[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Video[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Audio[/td]\n        [td]9[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Overall[/th]\n        [th]10[/th]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]"
